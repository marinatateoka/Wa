# Wa
Group Project

This project was developed by 6 students and it was the final project of the Web Developer Course at Enspiral Dev Academy.

It is an application where the main philosophy is to boost the interaction between people in the same community through exchange of activities (mahi) by time (wa).

Users can create a profile and from there, they can perform two actions: publish an activity that they need help to complete or help another person that published an activity. The time (activity duration) will be transferred from one user to another, like a “currency”.
